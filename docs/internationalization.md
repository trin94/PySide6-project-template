# Adding Languages

* Checkout repository
* Make sure development environment is set up correctly for your OS
* Create a new translation file by running
  ```shell
  just add-translation <locale>  # just add-translation fr_FR
  ```
* New `<locale>.ts` file appears in the `i18n` directory
* Translate the `ts` file using Qt Linguist 6
* To test the translation:
  * Add a new entry in the `MyAppLanguageModel.qml` file
  * Run
    ```shell
    just build-develop
    ```
